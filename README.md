# Weather Now
A simple website built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** that displays current weather information for any city using the **OpenWeatherMap API**. The project includes a minimal backend powered by **Node.js** and **Express.js** to securely fetch weather data and hide the API key from the frontend.
